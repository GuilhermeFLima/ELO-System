A script I wrote to calculate the ELO ratings for my 
students at the elementary school chess club where I 
volunteered.

The file **ELO.py** contains the main functions, and the file
**ratings.py** calculates the ELO ratings, ranks the students,
and also shows how many games each has played.

The script in **ratings.py** requires both a list of (ideally) all
students in the club, and also a list of games that have been
played. Currently these are writen into the file itself, 
but hopefully I'll implement the option to load these from excel 
spreadsheets fairly soon.
